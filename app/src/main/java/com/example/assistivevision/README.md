# 📱 Assistive Vision — Workshop Prerequisites

This repository contains the **starter project** for the  
**“Android in Action: Object Detection using ML Kit”** workshop.

⚠️ **Important:**  
This repository is meant **only for setup and environment verification**.  
The actual **object detection logic will be implemented live during the workshop**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

- Ensure everyone has the **same Android setup**
- Avoid Gradle / dependency issues during the workshop
- Start coding the real app without wasting time on configuration

If this app runs successfully on your machine, **you are fully ready for the workshop**.

---

## 🧠 What This App Does (Right Now)

Currently, the app:

- Uses **Jetpack Compose**
- Opens successfully in Android Studio
- Can access **Camera** and **Gallery**
- Has the correct **architecture structure**
    - UI → ViewModel → Helper

❌ It does **NOT** perform object detection yet  
❌ No ML logic is implemented yet

👉 That will be added **step by step during the session**.

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites (Must Be Installed)

Before the workshop, make sure you have:

- **Android Studio (preferred newer versions)**
- **JDK 11** (Android Studio default is fine)
- **Android SDK 36**
- A working:
    - Emulator **or**
    - Physical Android device (recommended for camera)

---

## 📦 Tech Stack Used

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture:** ViewModel + State-driven UI
- **ML:** ML Kit Vision (Object Detection) — *added during workshop*
- **Image Handling:** Camera & Gallery APIs

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPO_URL> 
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Wait for Gradle sync to finish
(first sync may take a few minutes — this is normal)

4. Run the app on **Emulator or Physical Android device**


> If something breaks, you can always return to this version.

## 🎉 You’re Ready!

If the app runs and shows the setup message:
